            My name is Daniel Tairov. I love playing volleyball, reading fiction books, and learning French.
            Talking about food, I like Kyrgyz, Italian, and Uygur national cuisines. When choosing movies,
            I especially prefer the following jenres: action, fiction, comedy. I do not actually have a
            list of favorite people but I admire leaders in their area of work.

         <p>
            Since I went outside of my country for the first time in 2018 when I went to the US,
            I have loved travelling. My life wish is to visit more than 50 countries. My ultimate dream
            is to open my IT-startup in Kyrgyzstan which would do outsourcing and create job posiitons 
            for local people.
